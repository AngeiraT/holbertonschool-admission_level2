				<h1>My Story</h1>
			
				<h3>( Based on a real story!) </h3>

				<p> Early this year, I decided to learn to code and it changed my perspective on learning. I am a wife, mom of a 8 year old ,and stepmom of a 15 year old girl. I also worked at three jobs ,as a tutor, swimmer instructor and a technology teacher.</p>
   
    <h2> How it all began </h2>
	
    <p> During my teaching days I had to learn all the basics about computers and coding. While trying to learn so I can teach my students ,who only knew the basics, I had to commit myself so they could understand and have fun at the same time. It is a challenge. This process grew an interst and  a spark into the world of coding.
    </p>
      <h2> The Decision </h2>
    <p> I decided to switch careers to programming which is a completely different field. Now, for me, my tutorial center was online videos, YouTube videos, etc. At first, I didn’t know how to start and I felt somewhat embarrassed and overwhelmed, I mean how will I go about this? Should I just download videos and keep watching? Do I need to look for a book and write everything said in the video? How will I remember everything I’ve been taught? And how will I know that I am doing it correctly? It occurred to me that learning is not that easy, and that’s where my first lesson in learning programming came from. </p>
    <h2> Stay out of your confort zone </h2>
    <p> The moment I started filling the application and felt that it was difficult but at the same time I knew if I didn't try I wasn't going to come out to the comfort and found out this could be something I could do for the rest of my life and teach others that everything is possible. Those dreams will come true. I convince myself I am  a<b> Dream getter.</b>
